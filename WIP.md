# Work In Progress - 2025-10-24

## Current Status: Sprint 5 - 85% Complete (BLOCKED)

### ‚úÖ Just Fixed (Last Session)
1. **Backend crash loop** - Server was dead from compilation errors
2. **Script upload broken** - PIN header missing (401 Unauthorized)
3. **PIN visibility** - Now shows dots instead of numbers
4. **Missing badge component** - Added shadcn/ui badge
5. **Lobby portraits missing** - Now passes analysis data to CharacterCard
6. **Name asked twice** - Creator's participantId now saved to localStorage
7. **participantId missing** - Backend now returns it when creating lobby

### üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER - Backend Won't Start
**Location**: `RunThru-backend/backend/src/services/lobby.service.ts` and `lobbies.routes.ts`

**Errors**: TypeScript compilation errors (see stderr from process f8bbd4)
- ~~`getDatabaseConnection` doesn't exist~~ (code looks correct now, might be cache)
- ~~`lobbyService` variable not defined~~ (code uses `getLobbyService()` correctly)
- ~~Missing `script.service` import~~ (removed)

**Status**: Code appears fixed but backend may still be in crash loop. Need to:
1. Kill all node processes
2. Clear nodemon cache
3. Restart backend server fresh

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Frontend dev server (port 3000)
- PIN entry page (password masked)
- Script upload UI
- Character selection with portraits
- Lobby creation flow
- Database schema (participants table exists)

### ‚ùå What's Broken
- Backend server (crash loop or compilation errors)
- Script upload (backend down = 500 errors)
- Lobby endpoints (backend down)
- Multiplayer flow (can't test until backend up)

## Sprint 5 Implementation Status

### Frontend Track (90% Done) ‚úÖ
- [x] PIN entry page with rate limiting
- [x] Lobby join page with character selection
- [x] Lobby status component
- [x] API hooks (useLobbies.ts)
- [x] Portrait data integration
- [ ] PIN validation middleware (usePINValidation hook)
- [ ] Shareable link UI in SessionSetup
- [ ] Rehearsal page updates

### Backend Track (80% Done - BLOCKED) üö®
- [x] Database schema (participants table)
- [x] PIN validation middleware
- [x] Lobby service (lobby.service.ts)
- [x] All lobby routes (lobbies.routes.ts)
- [x] participantId in create response
- [ ] GET /api/sessions/:id/config endpoint
- [ ] Session expiry middleware
- **BLOCKER**: Server won't start

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **CRITICAL: Fix Backend Server**
   - Kill all node processes
   - Clear nodemon/ts-node cache
   - Restart backend with clean process
   - Verify it starts and listens on port 4000

2. **Test Script Upload**
   - Upload a script with AI analysis
   - Verify portraits generate
   - Check database

3. **Test Multiplayer Lobby Flow**
   - Create lobby with name
   - Get shareable link
   - Open in incognito (simulate 2nd user)
   - Join with different name
   - Select characters
   - Start rehearsal

4. **Finish Sprint 5 Tasks**
   - Add usePINValidation hook
   - Add shareable link UI to SessionSetup page
   - Implement session expiry middleware
   - Update rehearsal page for multiplayer

## Files Modified This Session

### Frontend (`feature/frontend` branch)
- `src/components/script/ScriptUploader.tsx` - Added PIN header
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Password field for PIN
- `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Added component
- `src/app/lobby/[token]/page.tsx` - Fixed imports, added portraits
- `src/app/scripts/[id]/setup/page.tsx` - Save participantId on create

### Backend (`feature/backend` branch)
- `src/services/lobby.service.ts` - Return participantId
- (Other files appear correct but server won't start)

## Environment Status
- Node processes running: Multiple (some may be stale)
- Port 4000: Has a listener but server may be crashed
- Port 3000: Frontend running OK
- Port 5000: TTS service unknown

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Kill all node processes and restart
pkill -f node
cd RunThru-backend/backend && npm run dev

# Check what's on port 4000
lsof -i :4000

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

## Context Notes
- Sprint 5 was 95% in TASKS.md but actually 0% code (only planning)
- Previous implementation had bugs that broke script upload
- Backend compilation errors are cleared but server may need hard restart
- All git commits made to feature branches (not merged to main yet)
