**Session**: Sprint 3 Planning
**Status**: âœ… All decisions approved by @corey

## âœ… Approved Decisions

### 1. Voice Presets (8 total)
**Decision**: Use these 8 presets for MVP. Can add more later if needed.

1. **Teen Male** - Neutral, young, friendly
2. **Teen Female** - Neutral, young, friendly
3. **Angry Teen** - High emotion, aggressive
4. **Cheerful Kid** - High pitch, happy, playful
5. **Wise Elder** - Low pitch, slow, calm
6. **Mysterious Narrator** - Neutral emotion, storytelling cadence
7. **Angry Monster** - Very low pitch, aggressive (ZOMBIE, GHOST)
8. **Scared Character** - High pitch, nervous, fast

**Rationale**: Covers most theatrical roles. Simple enough for teens to understand. Can expand based on user feedback.

### 2. Character Card Emoji
**Decision**: Option B - Different emoji per role (detect from character name)

**Implementation**:
- Detect keywords in character name (ZOMBIE â†’ ðŸ§Ÿ, GHOST â†’ ðŸ‘», TEEN â†’ ðŸ§‘, etc.)
- Fallback to ðŸŽ­ if no match
- Keep it simple - don't try to be too clever with detection

**Concern**: Limited emoji variety for generic characters (BOY, GIRL, MAN, WOMAN)
**Mitigation**: Use gender-specific emoji where possible (ðŸ‘¦ðŸ‘§ðŸ‘¨ðŸ‘©), theater mask ðŸŽ­ as fallback

**Examples**:
- ZOMBIE â†’ ðŸ§Ÿ
- GHOST â†’ ðŸ‘»
- TEEN BOY â†’ ðŸ§‘
- TEEN GIRL â†’ ðŸ§’
- NARRATOR â†’ ðŸ“–
- ELDER/GRANDMA â†’ ðŸ‘µ
- GUARD â†’ ðŸ’‚
- MONSTER â†’ ðŸ‘¹
- Default â†’ ðŸŽ­

### 3. Mobile Testing Target
**Decision**: Lowest common denominator (middle school devices)

**Target Devices**:
- Budget Android phones (3-4 years old)
- Older iPhones (iPhone 8-11 range)
- Assumption: Friends sharing devices, not flagship phones

**Design Implications**:
- **Large touch targets**: 44px minimum (iOS guideline)
- **Simple animations**: Avoid heavy CSS effects that lag on old devices
- **Optimized images**: Small file sizes, lazy loading
- **Responsive font sizes**: Scale up for readability on small screens
- **Test on real device**: Borrow middle school phone if possible

**Performance Budget**:
- Page load: < 3 seconds on 3G
- Interaction response: < 100ms
- No janky scrolling

### 4. Voice Preview Sample Text
**Decision**: "Hi, my name is [CHARACTER NAME]." + one fun line from the script

**Implementation**:
- Template: `"Hi, my name is ${characterName}. ${sampleLine}"`
- `sampleLine`: Pick a short, punchy dialogue line from the character (10-20 words max)
- Preference: Early line from script (easy to find, representative of character)
- Fallback: If no good line, use: "Let's rehearse together!"

**Example**:
- TEEN: "Hi, my name is TEEN. I can't believe we're stuck in a zombie apocalypse!"
- ZOMBIE: "Hi, my name is ZOMBIE. Braaaains... must have braaaains!"
- NARRATOR: "Hi, my name is NARRATOR. Welcome to the stage, where anything can happen."

**Duration**: 5-10 seconds of audio (keeps GPU usage reasonable)

---

### 5. Auto-Assign Fallback
**Decision**: Option A - Random appropriate voice (fastest)

**Implementation**:
- If auto-assign rules can't detect gender/age/emotion, pick random from appropriate pool
- **Appropriate pool**: Exclude extreme voices (Angry Monster, Scared Character) for generic characters
- **Safe defaults**: Teen Male, Teen Female, Mysterious Narrator (neutral voices)
- User can always override after auto-assign

**Example**:
- Character: "PERSON 1" (no keywords detected)
- Auto-assign: Randomly picks Teen Male or Teen Female
- User can click to customize if needed

**Rationale**: Fast setup for large casts (30+ characters). Teens can experiment and adjust later.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. âœ… Install missing shadcn components: `select`, `slider`, `progress`, `label`
2. âœ… Create throwaway test for auto-assignment rules (test with 30-character script)
3. âœ… Document emoji detection rules
4. âœ… Begin component implementation (frontend worktree)
5. âœ… Begin service implementation (backend worktree)

### Research Needed:
- TTS parameter control (use tts-specialist agent)
- Voice preset â†’ TTS param mapping
- Voice sample generation strategy

**All decisions captured. Ready to proceed with implementation.** ðŸš€
