## 💡 User Feedback (Sprint 3 Planning)

### Teen-Friendly UX Improvements Needed:
1. **Bigger, clearer buttons** - Current UI too subtle for teens
2. **Interactive character cards** - Should be clickable/selectable
3. **Visual feedback** - Hover effects, highlights
4. **Clearer workflow** - "Step 1: Choose character → Step 2: Start"
5. **Coming soon messages** - Buttons that don't work yet should say so

### Expected User Flow:
1. User uploads script
2. User clicks on script card
3. **NEW**: User sees "Select Your Character" button
4. **NEW**: Dialog opens with character cards (clickable)
5. **NEW**: User selects their role
6. **NEW**: System auto-assigns voices to other characters
7. **NEW**: "Start Rehearsal" button becomes active
8. User clicks "Start Rehearsal" → Goes to rehearsal mode

## 🎯 Sprint 3 Scope

**Focus**: Role Selection & Voice Assignment

### Frontend Track:
- [ ] CharacterSelector dialog (clickable cards)
- [ ] VoiceSelector component (gender/emotion/age sliders)
- [ ] VoicePreview button (play sample)
- [ ] SessionSetup page (character + voice assignment flow)
- [ ] Update script detail page (add "Select Character" CTA)

### Backend Track:
- [ ] GET /api/voices endpoint (list available voices)
- [ ] POST /api/sessions endpoint (create rehearsal session)
- [ ] GET /api/sessions/:id (get session state)
- [ ] Voice auto-assignment logic (male names → male voice, etc.)

### TTS Track:
- [ ] List available voices from Index TTS
- [ ] Generate voice sample audio (30 sec clips)
- [ ] Voice parameter mapping (gender/emotion/age → TTS params)

---

## 📋 Sprint 3 Tasks (Detailed)

### Pre-Work:
- [ ] Design character selection UX (mockup/wireframe)
- [ ] Design voice assignment UI (sliders vs presets)
- [ ] Define voice auto-assignment rules
- [ ] Update TASKS.md with Sprint 3 breakdown

### Implementation:
- [ ] Build CharacterSelector component
- [ ] Build VoiceSelector component
- [ ] Build SessionSetup page
- [ ] Implement /api/voices endpoint
- [ ] Implement /api/sessions endpoint
- [ ] Test: Select character → Assign voices → Create session

### Integration:
- [ ] CHECKPOINT 2: Voice selection working end-to-end
- [ ] Merge to main
- [ ] Start Sprint 4 (Audio Generation)

## 🚀 Next Session Recommendations

1. **Start fresh conversation** - Save token budget for Sprint 3
2. **Review user feedback** - Clarify UX expectations
3. **Design first, code second** - Mockup character selection flow
4. **Use subagents** - frontend-specialist for UX research
5. **Throwaway test** - Voice auto-assignment logic (test with 30 characters)

## 💬 Context for Next Session

**Start with**: "We just completed Sprint 2 (script upload). Ready to start Sprint 3 (role selection & voice assignment). See `.claude/docs/sprint2-handoff.md` for context."

**Key decisions to make**:
1. Character selection UX design (how do teens select their role?)
2. Voice assignment strategy (sliders vs presets vs both?)
3. Auto-assignment rules (male names → male voice, ZOMBIE → angry voice)
4. Voice preview approach (generate samples upfront or on-demand?)

**Session complete. Ready to start fresh for Sprint 3!** 🎉
