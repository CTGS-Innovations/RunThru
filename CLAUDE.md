# RunThru - Theatrical Rehearsal Platform

## Project Overview
Interactive rehearsal app for teen actors to practice lines with AI scene partners. Built for local deployment with GPU-accelerated TTS.

## Target User
Teen actors (13-18) practicing for school plays and community theater productions.

## Architecture
This project uses **git worktrees** for parallel development:

- **Main** (`/home/corey/projects/RunThru`): Integration, testing, documentation
- **Frontend** (`/home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend`): Next.js UI
- **Backend** (`/home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend`): Node.js API + Python TTS service

All three share the same `.git` repository but work on separate branches.

### CRITICAL: Git Worktree Command Protocol

**MANDATORY RULES FOR CLAUDE:**

1. **NEVER run git commands without absolute path `cd` in the same command**
   ```bash
   # WRONG (relies on current directory):
   git add .
   git commit -m "message"

   # CORRECT (explicit worktree):
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend && git add . && git commit -m "message"
   ```

2. **File operations MUST specify which worktree:**
   - Frontend changes ‚Üí Read/Edit/Write in `/home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend/`
   - Backend changes ‚Üí Read/Edit/Write in `/home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend/`
   - Integration only ‚Üí Work in `/home/corey/projects/RunThru/`

3. **Before ANY commit, verify branch:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend && git branch --show-current
   # MUST show: feature/frontend

   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend && git branch --show-current
   # MUST show: feature/backend
   ```

4. **NEVER commit to main branch** (except merges)
   - If `git branch --show-current` shows "main" ‚Üí STOP
   - Move changes to feature branch or abort

5. **Command pattern for all git operations:**
   ```bash
   # Template:
   cd /absolute/path/to/worktree && git <command>

   # Examples:
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend && git status
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend && git add backend/src/routes/
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend && git commit -m "feat: Add component"
   ```

6. **Merging (ONLY from main worktree):**
   ```bash
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru && git merge feature/frontend
   cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru && git merge feature/backend
   ```

**Why this matters**: Omitting `cd` or relying on shell state causes commits to go to the wrong branch, leading to code loss and merge conflicts.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Zustand
- **Backend API**: Node.js 20, Express, SQLite (better-sqlite3), TypeScript
- **TTS Service**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, PyTorch, Index TTS, Chatterbox TTS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, Cloudflare Tunnel, NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB)

## Context Management Strategy
To prevent context pollution and enable parallel development:

### Specialized Subagents
Use these for research and planning (they have isolated context windows):
- **frontend-specialist**: UI/component architecture research
- **backend-specialist**: API/service architecture research
- **tts-specialist**: TTS integration and GPU optimization research

### How Subagents Work
1. Launch subagent for research: `use frontend-specialist to analyze [feature]`
2. Subagent reads relevant files (uses ITS OWN context, not main context)
3. Subagent saves plan to `.claude/docs/[feature]-plan.md`
4. Main agent reads plan (only a few hundred tokens) and implements

### Shared Memory
Subagents communicate via markdown files in `.claude/docs/`:
- `frontend-plan.md` - Frontend architecture plans
- `backend-plan.md` - Backend architecture plans
- `tts-integration-plan.md` - TTS service plans
- `integration-notes.md` - Cross-cutting concerns

## Data-Driven Decisions
Use **throwaway-tests/** for performance validation:
- Create isolated benchmarks for architectural decisions
- Compare multiple approaches with real data
- Document results in `docs/decisions/`
- Delete tests after decision is made (they're throwaway!)

Example: "Should we use Zustand or Context?" ‚Üí Create `throwaway-tests/001-state-management/` ‚Üí Run benchmark ‚Üí Document winner ‚Üí Delete test

## Task Tracking
**IMPORTANT**: This project uses `TASKS.md` for progress tracking.

### Your Responsibilities:
1. **Read TASKS.md** at start of each session to understand current sprint
2. **Update TASKS.md** as you complete tasks:
   - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` when done
   - Update üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** markers
   - Update progress percentages
   - Commit changes: `git add TASKS.md && git commit -m "tasks: Complete X"`
3. **Flag blockers** in "Blockers & Decisions Needed" section
4. **Notify @corey** when reaching üîç **CHECKPOINT** markers
5. **Update timestamps** ("Last Updated" field)

### TASKS.md is Synced:
- Lives in main worktree: `RunThru/TASKS.md`
- Symlinked to: `RunThru-frontend/TASKS.md` and `RunThru-backend/TASKS.md`
- All three point to the same file
- Git-tracked, so history is preserved

## Workflow
```
1. Research Phase
   ‚îî‚îÄ Launch subagent(s) for isolated research
   ‚îî‚îÄ Subagents save plans to .claude/docs/

2. Decision Phase
   ‚îî‚îÄ Review plans with human (critical decisions)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Run throwaway tests if data needed
   ‚îî‚îÄ Update TASKS.md with decisions

3. Implementation Phase
   ‚îî‚îÄ Main agent reads plan and implements
   ‚îî‚îÄ Work in appropriate worktree (frontend OR backend)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Mark tasks [x] in TASKS.md as you go

4. Integration Phase
   ‚îî‚îÄ Mark sprint complete in TASKS.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ Update status to üîç CHECKPOINT
   ‚îî‚îÄ Notify @corey for review
   ‚îî‚îÄ Merge feature branches to main
   ‚îî‚îÄ Test full stack in this worktree

5. Pattern Extraction
   ‚îî‚îÄ Document reusable patterns as Claude Code skills
   ‚îî‚îÄ Update TASKS.md with new sprint tasks
```

## Commands to Remember
- `/clear` - Reset context when switching between major features
- `use [subagent] to [task]` - Launch specialized research agent
- `git worktree list` - See all worktrees
- `git merge feature/frontend` - Integrate frontend work

## Key Documentation
- `docs/PRD.md` - Product requirements and features
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design and file structure
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` - This context management pattern
- `docs/decisions/` - Architectural decisions with supporting data
- `.claude/docs/` - Subagent research outputs (shared memory)
- `throwaway-tests/` - Performance benchmarks (temporary)

## Development Guidelines
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend work stays in RunThru-frontend/, backend in RunThru-backend/
2. **Context Hygiene**: Use `/clear` often, especially when switching features
3. **Data-Driven**: Validate performance claims with throwaway tests
4. **Human-in-Loop**: Present plans at decision points, don't guess
5. **Document Patterns**: Successful patterns ‚Üí Claude Code skills

## Current Phase
**MVP Phase 1** - Solo rehearsal mode with pre-generated audio
- Script upload and parsing (markdown ‚Üí JSON)
- Role selection and voice assignment
- Audio generation with Index TTS
- Linear playback rehearsal UI

See `docs/PRD.md#mvp-scope` for full phase 1 requirements.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Frontend development
cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-frontend
npm run dev  # localhost:3000

# Backend development
cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend/backend
npm run dev  # localhost:4000

# TTS service
cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru-backend/tts-service
python main.py  # localhost:5000

# Full stack integration
cd /home/corey/projects/RunThru
docker-compose up
```

## UI/UX Design Skill

RunThru has a Claude Code Skill that automatically activates when working on UI:

**Skill**: `.claude/skills/ui-ux-designer/SKILL.md`

**How it works**: This is a **model-invoked skill** - Claude automatically uses it when building, reviewing, or refactoring UI components. You don't need to explicitly call it.

**What it ensures**:
- Pokemon-card energy (exciting, not boring)
- Mobile-first responsive design (375px ‚Üí desktop)
- Brand colors (amber for user, cyan for AI, green for CTAs)
- Accessibility (keyboard nav, ARIA, 48px touch targets, 4.5:1 contrast)
- Component states (hover, selected, disabled, focus)
- Consistent patterns across all pages

**Core principle**: Every interaction should feel like starting an epic adventure, not filling out homework.

## Notes for Claude
- This is a father-daughter project - keep it professional but kid-friendly
- The user has 50 years of industry experience - present options, don't assume
- Use throwaway tests to validate performance claims
- Keep the user in the loop on architectural decisions
- When in doubt, ask rather than guess
