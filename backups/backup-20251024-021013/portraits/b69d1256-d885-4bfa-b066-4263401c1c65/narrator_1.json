  "prompt": "Character portrait of NARRATOR 1 for a theatrical production. A witty and insightful character who guides the audience through the story. They have a knack for humor and a strong stage presence.\n\nStyle: Modern illustrated poster art with stylized realism, like Pixar concept art meets Broadway poster. Painterly with soft gradients and light texture. Warm uplifting colors - sunset oranges, royal blues, deep purples, and golds. Dynamic cinematic composition with spotlight lighting.\n\nExpression: Confident and theatrical, expressive face with slightly exaggerated pose like animation stills or storybook illustrations. Emotionally rich and aspirational.\n\nQuality: Artistic but grounded, not photorealistic or cartoon. Similar to Spider-Verse posters, La La Land artwork, or Encanto promotional illustrations.\n\nIMPORTANT: NO TEXT, NO WORDS, NO LETTERS, NO LABELS in the image. Pure visual portrait only.",
